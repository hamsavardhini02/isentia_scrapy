By juxtaposing three works from three different periods we're not only given an overview of Sir Kenneth MacMillan's huge range; we're also reminded of how compulsively theatrical his instincts were, even when making ballets with no apparent plots. Concerto (1966), Rituals (1975) and Gloria (1980) have no stories to tell, yet all of them beckon us into narrative. Even Concerto - a Balanchine-influenced setting of Shostakovich's second piano concerto - has at its heart a pas de deux of intriguing, elusive romance. Gloria looks most like a story ballet in that its staging takes us directly into the wastelands of the second world war, yet it contains no images of fighting. MacMillan suspends the frank athleticism of his dancers' moves within a kind of otherworldly trance, creating a meditation on the limbo land between life and death. \n"},
